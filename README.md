# Colorless Sakura

The cherry flowers bloom thinking only of luring people to come gather under them. If you think just of all the gathering, across dozens and hundreds of years, then it seems they have a mysterious magical power, despite only being plants. The cherry blossoms at the back of the store made themselves white to better attract people’s eyes. And so they called Reimu’s redness, and thought of obtaining all the seven colors of the rainbow through that red-and-whiteness.
